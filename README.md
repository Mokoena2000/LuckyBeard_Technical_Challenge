If you get stagnant with free time and dont know what to do dont worry our AI assistant (MADALA) is always there to look up fun and exciting activitys for you to do in yiur home town

TECH STACK

Python / Django  - For back-end and user authentication also will be writing my unit test in python
HTML/ CSS - For a simple forntend and ui nothing much 
Postman - for API and API integration
Mysql - For the database to save the user login details and task/ wanted to use sqlite3 but because im planning on deploying the site with pythonanywhere which only allows mysql free tier its the go to
Relational Data Management and Persistance - To store the data in rows and columns - tables makes it easier to retreive data by its keys and also makes sure our data persist si when a user closes their browser and comes back there data is still stored and ready for them to use
CI/CD - for continues integration making sure everything thats pushed meets the requirements and does not fail or break anything also as an alert to stop and see whats failing and fix it as soon as possible
Docker has never been my strong point so for the sake of nothing breaking or a it works on my device issue ill leave it  out for now and push on

SET UP

For technical people who want to get their habds dirty and run on localhost
In your terminal clone the repository to you local device - git clone "link to the repository" change to the directory of the repo cd "repo name"
